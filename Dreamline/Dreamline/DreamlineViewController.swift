// @IDEA:
// In the other model, the update tick was called
// every frame interval, but since we can't do that
// at this level, we can trigger update by events
// calling functions in this class

// this class is connected to the Main.storyboard stuff
// so it's tough to do an init()
// this is basically rock bottom of the program
// @RENAME: I'm not sure if this is a 'ViewController' per se
//          Maybe something like 'DreamlineBase' or 'DreamlineProgram'
//          Whatever it is, it should indicate that this is the 'bottom' of the program

        //        This method is only expected to be called once,
        //        from here, views manage their own resources
        //        This class will be responsible for managing the
        //        FSM that controlls the subviews
