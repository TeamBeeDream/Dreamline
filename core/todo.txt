- setup renderer to take in MessageQueue of events
- make message queue behave like a ring buffer (ordered messages)
- setup main loop to pass events from logic update to renderer update


DIFFERENCES TO KEEP IN MIND:
- viewport size is multiplied (probably retina display)
- glsl version support is different
- need better checks to make sure glCreateProgram is actually returning a valid number (i.e. not 0)
- but other than that they seem pretty close
